#TeraMath
**A math library for Terasology**

### Overview

As the name inclines, TeraMath contains mostly math-related code with a focus on geometry.

### Status

This library is still *experimental* and not intended for productive use.

### Contributing

If your module contains a lot of math-related code and you consider sharing it with others, TeraMath is the place. Contact us either in IRC or send a Pull Request.

### Delaunay

The Delaunay diagram computation is loosely based on the Java port by [Connor Clark](www.hotengames.com) of [Alan Shaw's ActionScript3 implementation](https://github.com/nodename/as3delaunay).
This, in turn, is based on [Fortune's algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune's_algorithm) by Steven Fortune (licensed under MIT).
